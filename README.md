<h2>Project Portfolio Septian Nuriyanto</h2>

Hi, I'm a Junior Frontend Developer.

This is my first project to work on by enrolling coursera "CSS in Depth" course.

Implementing several aspects that I learned for about 3 weeks :
- Semantic HTML
- Flexbox HTML Layout
- CSS Styling
- CSS Animation using pseudo-element hover
